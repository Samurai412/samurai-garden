You start with +5 for Counter stat (Used when investigating), and +5 for Deception (When roleplaying a suspect). When you successfully counter a lie, you get a +1 for your Counter, but a -1 for your Deception, and vice versa if you succeed in deceiving. The max is 10 for one stat and 0 for another. (Don't ask me why, sounds fun :shrug:)



# Gameplay

1. Take turns exploring the crime science and finding clues until you think it's enough.
2. Interrogate suspects
3. When someone makes a claim or statement, you can choose to "Counter" it
4. Roll your Counter die against their Deception die
5. If you roll higher, you catch them in a lie or inconsistency and their Sus Meter increases.
6. If you roll lower, they successfully mislead you
7. When a suspect's Sus Meter reaches 10, OR in case you have been playing for too long, the suspect with the highest Sus Meter, players may try to provide plausible explanations for how this suspect killed the victim using the clues found in step 1 and they vote on it.


In addition to the Counter stat, investigators may use some abilities that will help conclude the case or make detecting lies easier. Below are some of these abilities generated with AI.
