## Gathering Intel
The first phase is basically just collecting clues and the gathering intel. This is done by in a turns for several rounds, there's no limit for how many rounds of gathering intel there can be. Player A suggests a clue, the remaining players write the clue and whether they approve of it or no. When this phase is over, the players will go through each of the suggested clues and check whether they go through or not. For a clue to go through, it must have at least 50% approval. Do note, however, that this doesn't mean the clue is a real. It can be a red herring. The true criminal might be cooperating with one of the detectives, as such they might be throwing red herrings here and there.
- The saboteur can be anyone, anyone can choose to be the saboteur, and everyone can be saboteurs.

## The Art of Abduction
Now that we have all the scene analyzed and all the clues observed. What comes next is forming conclusions. Any detective can step up and provide a conclusion, including the saboteur, the players vote in the same manner as the previous phase, however the results are immediately revealed. Now there are two things that can happen here:
1. You get the approval of 75%+ of the detectives. If you were a saboteur and gave a false conclusion, you outsmarted the detectives, congrats!
2. You get the approval of 75%+ of the detectives. Your conclusion had no presence of red herrings in it and it used all the correct clues.
3. You get the approval of 75%+ of the detectives. The saboteur may show up at this point and claim that your conclusion is incomplete due to not having all the correct clues or because it contains a red herring. It's most likely the saboteur that would show up and claim this, but some other player who say that one of their "correct" clues used not used. Similarly, the saboteur can claim that one of their red herrings was used. In this care the game continues until a player achieves one of the earlier conditions
4. You don't get the approval of 75%+ of the detectives. The game continues
