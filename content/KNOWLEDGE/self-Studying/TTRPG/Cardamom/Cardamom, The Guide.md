# Introduction




Cardamom's main goal is a complete roleplaying experience, to immerse the player in a whole new world. Not just rolling dice and levelling up. The main mechanic revolves around around creating custom cards for your character, this is what gives the characters' life (among other things). The idea of custom cards came up to me because I wasn't too happy with how TTRPGs are all about rolling dice. In Cardamom, dice still remain crucial, but they serve as a means to implement other mechanics, rather than being the main mechanic (More on this later)

## Setting 
TBW





## Game Goals
The goals of each character are unique to them, there's no one main objective. A character might want to have the strongest card in the game, another might want to kill a corrupt king, another might want to have company. You name it

### Examples of Character Goals

- **Tank**: Protect the kingdom from invading forces.
- **Warrior**: Become the champion of the arena.
- **Support**: Heal and unite the fractured tribes.
- **Mage**: Uncover ancient magical secrets.

# Getting Started
## Materials needed
- You need a D20
- Character sheets 
- This guide if need be
- Cards (Cut paper in rectangles if need be)
- A set of cards by the GM that represent the NPCs cards and the Soul Guardian cards

## How to Play
How to play largely depends on the campaign and setting you're going with. For example, you might go with a campaign that largely uses the Cards mechanic (More intense-fights focused), or you might go with a campaign that largely uses Non-Cards actions (Later on that), such campaign will be more adventure and exploration heavy. The default campaign offers a fair balance between the both -- Some sessions will be very card based, others the opposite.

Each character starts with 100 Spark. These sparks have many uses, but for now let's talk about the main thing: Buying cards. 
- Legendary: 100 Sparks
 - Epic: 60 Sparks
- Rare: 40 Sparks
- Uncommon: 15 Sparks
- Common: 10 Sparks
- Utility: GM estimate 
This allows the player to be creative with creating cards, coming up with plans, pt innovating a meta... who knows?

The GM sets up the campaign based on the characters and their goals. On a turn, a character can either perform a Non-card action, a Card action, or just pure roleplay with other characters.

## Basic Terminology
- Stealing: an NPC steals a card from a character while they are resting, stealing is mostly luck based.
- Valor: A specific resource for Tanks, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards
- Pride: A specific resource for Warriors, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards.
- Devotion: A specific resource for Supports, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards.
- Tanks: Strong defensive characters
- Warriors: Strong offensive characters
- Supports: Characters with healing abilities


## Character Creation

*When creating a character in Cardamom, first thing I would ask myself: "What is the goal of my character? What are they trying to achieve?" From this, you can go ahead and decide a lot of things, including the class, what type of cards to use, and finally their ideals* 

## Card Types
Let's explore the 6 types of cards: Attack, Defense, Support, Utility, and Items Cards.

#### Guidelines for creating Attack Cards

| Rarity        | DMG  | HP  | Cost      | Effects                            |
| ------------- | ---- | --- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Common**    | 1d6  | 12  | 1 Spark   | No effect other than the turn DMG  |
|               | 3d4  | 8   |           |                                    |
|               | 2d6  | 6   |           |                                    |
| **Uncommon**  | 3d4  | 18  | 2 Spark   | No effect other than the turn DMG  |
|               | 2d6  | 12  |           |                                    |
|               | 3d6  | 10  |           |                                    |
| **Rare**      | 3d6  | 24  | 3 Spark   | Effects up to 2 turns; read below. |
|               | 3d8  | 20  |           |                                    |
|               | 4d6  | 18  |           |                                    |
| **Epic**      | 4d6  | 32  | 1 Inferno | Effects up to 4 turns; read below. |
|               | 4d8  | 24  |           |                                    |
| **Legendary** | 5d10 | 40  | 2 Inferno | Effects lasting permanently        |
|               | 4d10 | 50  |           |                                    |
(More on Spark and Inferno later)
#### Guidelines for creating Defense Cards
| Rarity    | Defense | DP  | Cost      | Range                       |
| --------- | ------- | --- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Common    | 12      | 2   | 1 Spark   | Self-Defense                |
|           |         |     |           |                             |
| Uncommon  | 12      | 3   | 2 Spark   | Self-Defense                |
|           | 18      | 2   |           |                             |
|           |         |     |           |                             |
| Rare      | 18      | 4   | 3 Spark   | Defend Nearby Allies+Self * |
|           | 24      | 3   |           |                             |
|           |         |     |           |                             |
| Epic      | 24      | 4   | 1 Inferno | Defend Nearby Allies+Self * |
|           | 32      | 3   |           |                             |
|           |         |     |           |                             |
| Legendary | 50      | 5   | 2 Inferno | Defend All Allies           |
|           | 40      | 6   |           |                             |
|           |         |     |           |                             |
- Durability Points (DP) replaced the normal HP system for two reasons, one is to reduce the amount of calculations; second is to add a strategic depth, because a card is either broken from a single/combo attack within a single turn, such that the attack/combo zeros the defense or when their uses run out. A card must take any damage for its DP to go down by one.

** "Nearby Allies" in the case of defense refers to allies engaged with the same enemy or group of enemies.
** Defend All Allies refers to defending allies no matter their location.

#### Guidelines for creating Support cards
| Rarity        | Healing/Buffing | Max Cards to heal* | DP  | Effects                                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Common**    | 1d6             | 1                  | 2   | Self-heal                                                                              |
|               |                 |                    |     |                                                                                        |
|               |                 |                    |     |                                                                                        |
| **Uncommon**  | 2d6             | 1                  | 3   | Heal one ally                                                                          |
|               | 1d6             |                    |     | Buff an ally by adding a modifier to their next attack.                                |
|               |                 |                    |     |                                                                                        |
| **Rare**      | 3d8             | 2                  | 4   | Healing nearby allies for a single round OR buffing them                               |
|               | 2d6             |                    |     | Buff nearby allies by adding a modifier to their next attacks.                         |
|               |                 |                    |     |                                                                                        |
| **Epic**      | 4d8             | 3                  | 5   | Self-heal + nearby allies for 2 rounds                                                 |
|               | 3d8             |                    |     | Buff for 2 rounds, 2nd round gets half the buff (i.e. half of what you roll)           |
| **Legendary** | 5d10            | 6                  | 2   | Heal all allies for 4 rounds OR revive someone                                         |

* * "Max cards to heal" refers to the amount of cards you can simultaneously heal with your card if you choose to heal cards instead of base HP.
* If your character is a Support, your support card have no DP, and they have unlimited uses. Your cards become indestructible, but your base HP is more vulnerable. If your character is another class, then you will have the DP above before they break. Only exception is the Legendary card. DPs are for all classes in this case.

#### Guidelines for Utility cards
These cards have no predefined cost or any guidelines, it's up to imagination, and the cost is judged by the GM, some examples:
- Give your ally one of your cards 
- Compare your power level with your enemy's, whoever has lower power becomes a slave for the other
- Recover a destroyed card
- Take a look at your enemy's cards
#### Soul Guardian 
The only type of cards that canâ€™t created by the players. Drawn from a special deck after death, these cards allow players to support their allies from beyond the grave. After majorly contributing and assisting the party, the character gets revived/reincarnated, and also keeps their SG cards. A dead soul can draw a SG card once every 3 turns.
#### Item Cards
Before starting the campaign, the GM, along with the players if they wanted, may create some physical items to put on shops found all across the game world. These aren't your typical cards; they're **Item Cards** that bring an extra layer of strategy and interaction to your adventures. For example, you might have a shield card. Which is a passive card that is always active. It reduces 50% of any incoming damage, it has a max amount of uses before breaking (DP), in which case players can go to a shop to repair it with half of the amount it was bought, or just buy another item. These cards also consume Sparks. The shield card you might consume 1 Spark for each turn it receives damage. When creating a character, you can't have Item Cards yet. You can either buy them, or steal them.

###  Character Classes

*Let's suppose my character wants to save the princess from the corrupt king, it will only make sense for my character to be a warrior*

The following is the HP for each class

| Class    | Base HP |
| -------- | ------- |
| Tanks    | 100     |
| Support  | 60      |
| Warriors | 80      |


> [!NOTE] Card Classes
> In Cardamom, most types of cards are assigned a class. So when you create your own cards, they are assigned your class.
> Now if you somehow obtain a card that was assigned a class different from yours. The card is pretty useless, as it's only compatible with its original class. For it to work, you need to sprinkle it with some specific resource. Such resource will convert it to your class by imbuing it with your class characteristics. 
> *Shoutout to Mr. Nonov for this idea.*

###### Tank
- Tanks are always in the frontline, ready to sacrifice themselves for their teammates. As such, they have the strongest build
- Tanks have their own specific resource, these resources can be exchanged with Sparks from your local Walmart, or they can be used to imbue other cards with your holy ***Valor***.  To convert a card to the tank class, you spend 2 Valor. This will add the following effects to the card:
	- Roll a d6 to determine the amount of HP that will be added to the attack card's HP
	- If it was a defense card, divide the roll result by two to get the DP that will be added to it.
	- If it was a support card, divide the roll result by two to get the DP that will be added to it. If a support card was originally not your class, it will lose its "immunity"
	
How to gain Valor:
- Gain 1 Valor each time the Tank takes 20+ damage in a single turn.
- Gain 1 extra for each ally protected from damage in a turn
###### Warrior

Warriors are the first to attack an enemy, ready to sacrifice themselves for their own pride as warriors. As such, they have the second strongest build

- Warriors have their own specific resource, these resources can be exchanged with Sparks from your local Walmart, or they can be used to imbue other cards with your holy ***Pride***.  To convert a card to the warrior class, you spend 2 Pride. This will add the following effects to the card:
	- Roll a d6 to determine the amount of DMG that will be added to the attack card's DMG as a modifier.
	- If it was a defense card, divide the roll result by two to get the DMG that will be added to it. As such, for every attack on your defense card, your defense card will work as shield and a mini-spear.
	- If it was a support card, divide the roll result by two to get the DP that will be added to it. If a support card was originally not your class, it will lose its "immunity"
How to gain Pride:
- Gain 1 Pride each time the Warrior deals a critical hit (Max DMG) or defeats an enemy in single combat.
- Gain 1 Pride for achieving 32+ damage in a single turn. 
###### Support

Ah! What's a party called if they have no support? A headless party! Who is gonna pull you together and be there for you when you are getting slapped left and right? Supports are the backbone of any serious party. Their resource is called ***Devotion***. To convert a card to the warrior class, you spend 2 Pride. This will add the following effects to the card:
	- Roll a d6 to determine the amount of Health that will be added to the attack card. When attacking an enemy, you can heal an ally at the same time. 2 in 1.
	- If it was a defense card, divide the roll result by two to get the Self-heal that will be added to it. As such, for every attack on your defense card, you will be to heal your base HP or any of your cards' HP.
	- If it was a support card, you add 1.5x to  
How to gain Devotion:
- Gain 1 Devotion for each healing or buff action that significantly aids an ally.
- Gain 1 Devotion for saving an ally from death.

# Mana System

Cardamom utilizes a tiered mana system called "Sparks," "Blaze," and "Inferno":

- **Spark:** Gained passively (2 per turn). Used to play Common, Uncommon, and Rare cards.
- **Inferno:** Requires sacrificing 3 Sparks. 1 Inferno is used to play an Epic card, while 2 is used to play a Legendary card.
You can't convert Spark to Inferno and use the Inferno in the same turn. Therefore you need strategic planning for your resources.


### Roleplay Lines

Cards can have optional "Roleplay Lines" - phrases your character utters when playing the card for added thematic effect.


To reiterate:

| Class    | Base HP |
| -------- | ------- |
| Tanks    | 100     |
| Support  | 60      |
| Mages    | 60      |
| Warriors | 80      |
Each Character starts with 100 Sparks to buy cards:

| Rarity    | Cost Of Buying |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Common    | 10             |
| Uncommon  | 15             |
| Rare      | 40             |
| Epic      | 60             |
| Legendary | 100            |
| Utility   | GM estimates   |
After finally creating the cards; you go ahead and create up to 4 ideals that reflects your character's beliefs and motivations. These ideals are used  when performing Non-card actions. 


#### Equipment and Inventory
Before starting the campaign, the GM, along with the players if they wanted, may create some fictional items to put on shops found all across the game world. These items are also cards, but a rather different type of cards. For example, you might have a shield card. Which is a passive card that is always active. It reduces 50% of any incoming damage, it has a max amount of uses before breaking (DP), in which case players can go to a shop to repair it with half of the amount it was bought, or just buy another item. These cards also consume Sparks. The shield card you might consume 1 Spark for each turn it receives damage.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Card Actions

Card actions are the primary way characters interact with the world. Players can use cards for attacking, defending, supporting, and performing various special actions.


### Non-card based actions

- Actions that can't be represented by cards follow the simple system of ideals.
- The GM sets a target difficulty for an action.
- If the action aligns with an ideal, you may roll an additional die.

### Combat

Combat in Cardamom is a tactical and strategic affair. Players can use a combination of attack, defense, and support cards to overcome their foes. The GM will set the scene, describe the enemy, and determine the initiative order.

#### Combat Rules

1. Players can play a maximum of 2 cards per turn.
2. Support cards take up 2 slots.
3. If attacked without playing a card, the damage goes towards the character's base HP.

Players must declare which character their cards are targeting before the GM flips the cards. For example, consider the following:

1- Luis plays 2 attack cards aimed at Mario
2- Mario plays 1 defense card and 1 attack card aimed at Jenna
3- Jenna plays a support card to heal Luis
4- Derrek plays one attack card aimed at Luis

Now to resolve this, the GM follows the following procedure:
1- Before flipping the cards, the GM asks each player towards who their cards are.
2- Then in any random order we start resolving the conflicts. We start with Mario playing 2 attack cards. We roll the dice for the first attack card and we go to Mario, we see if he played any defense cards, if so then we see how much DMG the defense card absorbed. If all the defense was exhausted, then the defense card gets discarded and Luis can add it to his deck. Any surplus damage will damage Mario's other card which is attack. Now, make no mistake, even if Luis's attack is so strong that it even destroys Mario's remaining card. Mario will still be able to use his attack card to deal damage, as mentioned earlier, the order doesn't matter, if you played an attack card, you will do attack even if you're dead the next turn from the damage you received. Keyword on the *next turn*
3- So Mario attacks the poor Jenna who just wanted to support Luis. Jenna played a support card, which is untouchable. The damage instead goes to her BASE HP (or her shield if she has a shield item). Mario rolls the damage and attacks the defenseless Jenna
4- Jenna heals Luis, either his card(s) or his base HP. Jenna isn't able to heal any damage Luis receives this round, because we don't want the order to matter.
4- Derrek plays one card at Luis, roll the damage then damage any available cards that Luis has played. If someone else destroyed the two cards then the damage goes towards the HP

Key Takeaways:
- Order doesn't matter much, if we started with Derrek damaging Luis, the outcome will be the same. 
- If a card of Character C was destroyed by Character A, then Character B attacks Character C, then the damage will go towards the other card Character C played, if there was no second card, or if it was destroyed then damage goes to Base HP. Attack is the only exception to the "Effects don't take place in the same turn", in order to allow combos.

After this, the GM may narrate what happened in real time. Jenna was healing Luis, but Mario disrupted her, so he wanted to interrupt her and succeeds in doing so, Luis, however, anticipates this and charges at Mario. Mario reacts defensively, but the force of Luis's attack overwhelms him. Seeing this as an opening, Derrek seizes the moment and launches a surprise attack on Luis.
* * The narration mostly depends on the outcome of all the cards played, and it makes more sense that the players themselves contribute to what just happened by explaining what happened in real time.


### Leveling Up

Characters can level up by acquiring class-specific resources through their actions in combat and roleplay. These resources can be converted to Sparks and used to upgrade existing cards or create new ones.

### Stealing and Downtime

During downtime (sleep), players can gamble by declaring they "won't roll X" on a d6. If they roll X, they choose one of their cards to discard; if they don't, they earn 10 Sparks (Optional). Additionally, combat allows players to destroy enemy cards and potentially add them to their decks.

### Resurrection
If you are resurrected, whether by being a Soul Guardian or an ally revived you. You will draw 5 random cards from a deck, and you will start with half of original health. Additionally, you will have 50 Sparks, either you buy 
more/better cards with them, or just use the Sparks to play cards


### Class Resources Conversion
1 Class Resource = 15 Sparks

Optional mechanics below:


### Card Crafting System:

Players can combine two existing cards to create a new, more powerful card. The process works as follows:

- Choose two cards of the same rarity to combine.
- Roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, the crafting succeeds.
- The new card takes on properties from both original cards:
    - Damage: Average of both cards + 1d4
    - HP/DP: Highest of the two cards + 1d4
    - Effects: Choose one effect from each card, if there are no effects for each, then the new card will have no effects.
- The new card's rarity increases by one level (e.g., two Uncommon cards create a Rare card).
- Crafting consumes 20 Sparks.
- Failed attempts don't consume the cards but do use up the Sparks.

###  Ritual Cards

Ritual cards are powerful cards that require multiple players to set up and activate. Often having effects for multiple
- Ritual cards have a "Charge" value from 1-5.
- Each turn, a player can add 1 Charge to the card by spending 2 Sparks.
- When fully Charged, the card can be activated for a powerful effect.
- Examples:
    - "Summon an Ally" (Charge 3): Summons a creature to fight alongside the party for 3 rounds.
    - "Rewind" (Charge 5): Allows the party to reroll any dice rolls for the next 2 rounds.


### Shared Party Deck
The party has access to a small deck of shared cards:

- The shared deck starts with 3 cards, one of each: Attack, Defense, and Support.
- New cards can be added to the shared deck by unanimous party decision and spending 30 Sparks.
- Each player can use one card from the shared deck per session.
- After use, the card returns to the shared deck at the end of the session.
- The shared deck has a maximum size of 5 cards.
