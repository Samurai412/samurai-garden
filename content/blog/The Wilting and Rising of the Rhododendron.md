The rain poured from the ceiling. And with every drop slamming against the surface, the young girl' will to live had poured, and poured. 

Nothing is going right in my life, so why should I keep living? It's pointless. The young girl thought as she wrapped herself in the sheets, to protect her from the cold, and to protect her from the unforgiving outside world. 
Her peace was short-lived, the self-centered mom had interrupted her. The coldness from her mom's thundering added to her own.

A mother that wouldn't let an ant scurry across the kitchen floor in peace, surely won't let her daughter do the same. People stomp on ants, only thinking about their gains from doing so, they never care about the other side. That's what humans continue to do to each other continuously. 

This thought, and others similar, were the fuel to her will to live being poured out.  The constant feeling of being suffocated by her mother, and the world, chipped away at her spirit, leaving her feeling empty and hopeless. 

Just like always, urge of defiance grew in her, but quickly stifled by the penetration of her mother's voice. "Come here, you whore! "

Why am I even obeying her? I don't want to live anymore, so why do I care? her legs gravitated towards the kitchen like a robot. 

Do I have control over my body? Is it moving on its own? I just said I don't wanna live anymore. She stopped in the middle of hallway leading to the kitchen. A short moment of tranquility. The gentle breeze against her downcast eyes played a mournful melody only she could hear. She was timid, timid to live, timid to die, timid to face the gloomy wind. Whatever was bestowed upon this girl, was clearly the work of evil. 

"Where are you, you flat-chested whore?", the stentorian voice, booming and authoritative, originated from the kitchen.

There she was, the downcast girl, stood–or rather simply existed– in front of her mother. 

"Why don't you answer?"
"Sorry. I'm he–"

The weight of the whole world formed in the mother's palm then struck her face. 

So that's what it means to be crushed by the world, she thought.

"Go buy bread for us, and buy me this lipstick from the store" She showed an image of a red lipstick on her phone. "Get out of my face now,"

As ironic as it sounds, being outside is her only sanctuary from this world. The rain caressed her scalp, as if it was telling her, "I'm still there for you,"

She'd done her chores, the steam from the bread warming her hands, and as always, her suicidal thoughts have evaporated. She arrived around the corner where her house is, her footsteps synched with her heartbeat, a sense of impending doom approaching her. There it was, the river besides the house had flooded due to the heavy rain. All the windows shattered. The furniture is overturned. Some of the personal belongings were swept outside, none of these were hers. She didn't have any personal belongings to begin with. Her mother's white scarf; her mother's purse; her mother's heels; her mother's fancy clothes. The mother's childhood photos, all were now irreparably damaged. Some were burned to ashes, some were soaked and ruined among the ruins.

As she looked at the devastation, she marveled at the sheer power of nature. It was as if, for once, the world had turned in her favor.

She wasn't sad at all, she felt free, she is no longer homeless, as she can now be in her true world forever. Whatever happened to her mom, she didn't give a thought, and just spend pondering what happened.

So, this is how rain can be there for me? 

Timid she no longer was; even the wilted rhododendron seemed to be regaining its strength. Actually standing she was. The wind played a happy melody against her face, one that sets her free.
