# Lesson #1: Poetry as Play

We’re told poetry has to be unreachable to be good. Obscure, academic. But poetry is simply the language of being human, of having a heart that feels things and a mind that thinks things. And that’s a language anyone can speak.

  

Hi, I’m Emma! In this course, I’ll introduce you to the playful side of poetry through a series of simple, non-intimidating exercises. The lessons are sequenced to ease you into writing poetry so carefully that you may not even notice you’re doing it.

  

Along the way, we’ll cover topics like:

- thinking in verse
- playing with space
- understanding poetic form
- seeing poetry as a form of music
- owning your own poetic voice

  

Each lesson will end with a playful exercise. Because the course is hands-on, it’s beneficial whether you’re looking to publish poetry or dabble in a new art form. (PS, these exercises also make a great warmup for your pre-existing writing routine.) Alright, shall we?

## Intro to Poetry

Let’s set the stage with one of my favorite poems by the contemporary American poet, Billy Collins. It’s called (fittingly) ‘Introduction to Poetry.’

  

> I ask them to take a poem
🫴📖❓
> and hold it up to the light
🫴🔝💡
> like a color slide
🌈⛷️
>   

> or press an ear against its hive.
🤚💨✍️
>   

> I say drop a mouse into a poem
🐁🫳📖
> and watch him probe his way out,
🐁🕵️🔚
>   

> or walk inside the poem’s room
🚶📖🧱🚪
> and feel the walls for a light switch.
🤏🫷🖐️👐🧱💡
>   

> I want them to waterski
🫵↪️🌊🏂
> across the surface of a poem
🏄📖
> waving at the author’s name on the shore.
👋🧔🖊️📃
>   

> But all they want to do
🚫
> is tie the poem to a chair with rope
😵📖✅
> and torture a confession out of it.
🔥👊🔡
>   

> They begin beating it with a hose
👊🚿
> to find out what it really means.
😔🤔🤔🤔
  

Billy Collins wants to remind us that poetry should be an act of discovery rooted in curiosity and play. So for our first exercise, let’s play with his poem itself.

## The First Exercise

Take the poem above and translate it into nothing but emojis. You can be as literal or metaphorical as you’d like. Consider how you lay out the emojis on the page: are they tightly crammed? Are they airy, with space between them? Should you use a whole string of the same emoji in places for emphasis? Have fun with it!

## A Bonus Exercise

If you’re up to it, why not try the reverse? Take this string of emojis below and translate it into a poem. [_Note: we will build up to writing full poems later, so it’s ok to hold onto this exercise if you aren’t ready yet._]

See you tomorrow for the next one!
