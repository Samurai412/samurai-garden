# Introduction

![[Drawing 2024-06-25 14.57.03.excalidraw.png]]


Cardamom's main goal is a complete roleplaying experience, to immerse the player in a whole new world. Not just rolling dice and levelling up. The main mechanic revolves around around creating custom cards for your character, this is what gives the characters' life (among other things). The idea of custom cards came up to me because I wasn't too happy with how TTRPGs are all about rolling dice. In Cardamom, dice still remain crucial, but they serve as a means to implement other mechanics, rather than being the main mechanic (More on this later)

## Setting 
TBW





## Game Goals
The goals of each character are unique to them, there's no one main objective. A character might want to have the strongest card in the game, another might want to kill a corrupt king, another might want to have company. You name it


# Getting Started
## Materials needed
- You need a D20
- Character sheets 
- This guide if need be
- Cards (Cut paper in rectangles if need be)
- A set of cards by the GM that represent the NPCs cards and the Soul Guardian cards

## How to Play
How to play largely depends on the campaign and setting you're going with. For example, you might go with a campaign that largely uses the Cards mechanic (More intense-fights focused), or you might go with a campaign that largely uses Non-Cards actions (Later on that), such campaign will be more adventure and exploration heavy. The default campaign offers a fair balance between the both -- Some sessions will be very card based, others the opposite.

Each character starts with 100 Spark. These sparks have many uses, but for now let's talk about the main thing: Buying cards. 
- Legendary: 100 Sparks
 - Epic: 60 Sparks
- Rare: 40 Sparks
- Uncommon: 15 Sparks
- Common: 10 Sparks
- Utility: GM estimate 
This allows the player to be creative with creating cards, think of a plan, innovate a meta... who knows?

The GM sets up the campaign based on the characters and their goals. On a turn, a character can either perform a Non-card action, a Card action, or just pure roleplay with other characters.

## Basic Terminology
- Stealing: an NPC steals a card from a character while they are resting, stealing is mostly luck based.
- Valor: A specific resource for Tanks, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards
- Pride: A specific resource for Warriors, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards.
- Devotion: A specific resource for Supports, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards.
- Arcane Knowledge: A specific resource for Mages, can be used to promote cards, or create new powerful cards.
- Tanks: Strong defensive characters
- Warriors: Strong offensive characters
- Supports: Characters with healing abilities
- Mages: Characters with strong magical abilities
- Upgrading: Upgrading cards to a higher rarity with class resources
- All cards have the following format:  Damage/Cost/Defense/Additional Effects

## Character Creation

> [!warning] How to read this section
> Text in *italic* is just advice, you don't have to follow it to create a character that complies with the game rules.

*When creating a character in Cardamom, first thing I would ask myself: "What is the goal of my character? What are they trying to achieve?" From this, you can go ahead and decide a lot of things, including the class, what type of cards to use, and finally their ideals* 

*Let's suppose my character wants to save the princess from the corrupt king, it will only make sense for my character to be a warrior*

Warriors have 80HP
Support/Mages have 60HP
Tanks have 100HP

*Now that I have identified what class is my character, it's time to give him some cards that will aid in his goal*

> [!caution] ####  Rare Cards Effects
> Effects: Playing a Rare card can have effects lasting up to 2 turns (Such as freezing, melting, whatever, some might disable the enemy, some might damage then for each turn. In the case of damage, it follows the above pattern respectively: d8/d6/d6; to determine the total damage for these two turns)


> [!attention] #### Epic Cards Effects
> Effects: Playing a Epic card can have effects lasting up to 4 turns (Such as freezing, melting, whateva, some might disable the enemy, some might damage then for each turn. In the case of damage, a D4 is rolled every turn whilst the effect is taking place 

> [!caution] #### Legendary Cards Effects
> Effects: Playing a Legendary card can have effects lasting permanently until the card is destroyed (Such as freezing, melting, whatever, some might disable the enemy, some might damage them for each turn. In the case of damage, d10 for each turn. 


This table provide guidelines for creating cards, cards in each type with higher probability of a higher damage are balanced by having lower HP. One of the strengths of Cardamom is how much room it gives for customizability. For example, the players and the GM might introduce new ways of creating cards, if someone doesn't want the effects that come with the cards, they can compensate that by adding more DMG. In the stock version, you don't have to provide effects for your cards, though you won't be compensated with more DMG output. Feel free to discuss this with your party if you want to change it.
