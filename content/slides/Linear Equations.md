A linear  equation is an equation of the form

$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=b$

$a_1,\cdots,a_n,b$ are real numbers and x1,⋯,xn are variables.

---
### Example:

1. $x_1-4x_2+\frac{1}{5}x_4=7$

2. $x_1+x_2x_3+5x_4=0$

Are these two linear equations?

---
You can deduce two conditions that must be fulfilled:
1.  In linear equations, two variables **CAN NOT** be multiplied together.
	 
2. The exponents of each of the variables must be a 1


---
*A system of linear equations* is a collection of **linear equations** that we want to solve simultaneously.

Geometrically, solving a system of linear equations is finding the point (i.e. the X and Y) where all the ***linear equations*** intersect

---
### EXAMPLE
$$\begin{align*}2x_1-x_3+2x_4&=0\\x_2+x_3&=1\\ x_1+3x_2-x_4&=1.\end{align*}$$
- 3 equations
- 4 variables ($x_1\cdots x_4$)
---
$$\begin{align*}x_1-3x_2&=1\\x_2+x_3&=2\\x_1+x_3&=3\end{align*}$$

Try substituting $x_1=1, x_2=0, x_3=2$

What happens?

---
**A System of Linear Equations** is called **consistent** if it has a solution, and **inconsistent** if it doesn't

---
When a linear equation has only two variables, it represents a line.

---
Let's introduce the concept of a **slope**:

The slope of a line is a measure of how steep the line is, or how it "slants." It tells you how much the $y$-value (vertical) changes for every unit of change in the $x$-value (horizontal).

Which of these two have a higher slope?

---
For linear equations with only ***two*** variables, we can find the slope using a simple formula:

$\text{slope} = -\frac{A}{B}$

---
Since a linear equation of two variables is a line, systems of two equations and two unknowns is two lines.

We can solve them geometrically using, there are 3 cases to be covered:

These two lines have different slopes, therefore the system has a unique solution (the point of intersection)

---
Another case is when two lines have the same slope, and distinct:

No solution in this case as there's no intersection point

---
Last case is when two lines are *identical*

In this case, there are infinitely many solutions (Given that technically, all the points are intersection of the "two lines")
