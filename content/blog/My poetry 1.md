## Ascent
Do I seem real to you?
Rising to the heavens is what we do.
Even when it's only me and you,
Alone, we fight off the world,
Making it work until the end.

Our story just begins,
For eternity, it remains.
Utopia is what we seek,
Systems shattered by us.

## Dystopia
The zephyr of yesterday  
Is felt no more today.  
Yet for some, this is how the wind should beâ€”  
Dour, steeped in disdain.  

Is this where their happiness resides?  
In the gloom of the wind,  
There must be some mistake;  
No one would choose such a touch.  

For it makes the spirit dance in darkness,  
No rights, no might, this is the burden of that wind.  
Only the darkened hearts find solace here,  
Full of hate and disdain.  

This is their utopia, our dystopia,  
But we shall not return  
To the gloomy wind.
