A myriad of airborne creatures and vehicles blocked the sun's light, turning the day into night. A menacing aura radiated from them, suffocating the air with a sense of dread. Even the most nimble of humans stood no chance against their speed once their gaze locked onto a target. They numbered in the millions, if not billions, but stood no taller than gnomes.

There was a girl who bore witness to this massacre. Her name was Luna. She hid under a small window in her house, her heart drumming in her chest. Her eyes, like sapphire gemstones—deep, vivid, and magical—had always smiled at everyone. But now, there was no one to smile at. They were all gone. Luna saw it all, and from terrifying proximity.

A child ran past her window, screaming and fleeing. Luna’s eyes followed him and caught sight of an alien, strolling leisurely as if he were having ice cream in the middle of Paris. But in reality, he was toying with his victim—the young child.

In a flash, the alien dashed forward, injected something into the child, and then disappeared. He was the embodiment of speed, too fast for Luna’s sapphire eyes to catch. The child lay unconscious. The injection was poisonous; it chemically reacted with the blood, turning it green and sucking out every last drop—in other words, the slowest possible death.

She could barely breathe from the horrifying scene before her. But she mustered enough courage to think of a plan.

*Should I try to revive the child?* Worry snaked through her. *But I’m too safe here. We have hope if one of us survives. I shouldn’t give away my location.*

Her sensation of safety evaporated in an instant as that same alien appeared. He was much shorter than her, but fear made him seem to tower over her.

He smirked, took out his tongue, and licked his lips as if he had found a meal. Luna’s lips twitched in fear as she looked heavenward, silently pleading for rescue. Realizing none would come, she lowered her head, blinked, and met the alien’s eyes with newfound resolve.

Her heart pounded with adrenaline, and flames of anger shot through her. She instinctively kicked the alien in the groin, just as she would against any boy who dared harass her. The alien was hindered enough; the groin area was even more sensitive for this species than it is for humans.

Rage swept over him, his ego pulverized by this young girl. His anger made him punch the air and walls, forgetting about Luna.

A hand rested on his shoulder. "Stop this, my brother," the newcomer said softly. "I'll avenge you."

His brother was part of the Elite Group in the alien army—a rare unit, but one composed of members as tall as humans.

All the while, Luna was running. She was aware of their near-light speed, and in her head, it was only a matter of time before she was dead. She ran outside, everything around her tinged with green. The most terrifying thing was the silence—it was a quiet invasion, with no missiles, no damage to the buildings. It was like a green soup that smelled like a ton of rotten eggs.

And then he was there. A much taller alien suddenly appeared in front of her, grabbing her by her ponytail—the chocolate brown curls cascading in radiant spirals, each bounce reflecting a playful elegance and catching the light with a warm, lucid sheen. The beautiful chocolate brown hair was polluted by dirty, dark green hands with long, filthy nails.

He played with her hair. "I wasn’t aware that humans were capable of giving birth to such a beautiful thing."

Her sapphire eyes looked lifeless and hopeless. "I wish I could keep you as my toy, but you hurt my brother. The price for that is death."

"As if I care, you gross bean."

He lifted his hand and extended it toward her to inject her, and he did.

Perhaps she wasn’t truly hopeless after all. In an instant, something extraordinary occurred—time itself shifted. Suddenly, she found herself aboard a spaceship, a strange sensation beneath her. Glancing down, she realized it was a tail… her tail. Her overwhelming desire to survive had altered the fabric of the universe, transforming her into something new—half alien, half human. Indeed, she was a miracle girl, defying all odds to rewrite her destiny.

Across the ship, an alien addressed his comrades. "My fellow beings! We owe our gratitude to Luna for informing us about our new allies, the Human Race. In just a few moments, we will arrive on Planet Earth and convene with the World Government to discuss our future cooperation. I urge you all to conduct yourselves with the utmost respect and dignity as we embark on this historic journey of collaboration."
